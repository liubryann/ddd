# Due Diligence for Dummies

Submission for HackWestern 7

Due Diligence for Dummies lets a brand new investor look up any stock and see for themselves, in plain English, how regular investors like you and I, and large investing firms are feeling about a particular stock. We’re not giving out any advice, but it rules out any complicated numbers and calculations in a regular chart and gives the new investor an opportunity to get a high level glance of the public’s opinion of a stock and potentially come to a decision on their own.
