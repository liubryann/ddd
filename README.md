# Due Diligence for Dummies

Submission for HackWestern 7

## What it does

Due Diligence for Dummies lets a brand new investor look up any stock and see in plain English, how retail investors and institutional investors are feeling about a particular stock. It rules out complex numbers, graphs, and equations which gives the new investor an opportunity to get a high level glance of the publicâ€™s opinion of a stock and helps them come to a decision on their own.

## How it works

Due Diligence for Dummies works by providing our Python backend with a timeframe and stock symbol, which scrapes the internet in real-time for articles and posts about a stock and uses our natural language processing models to generate a sentiment analysis and summary of the material. Alongside that, we used React to display all the data for our frontend, and Redux and Express to communicate to our server.
